# TS-React-Redux-Starter-Kit

The purpose of this project is to get you a bunch of most popular front-end technologies together in one place.
My primary goal to make this project actually gives you a stable production-ready starter kit which is possible to build modern SPA applications. 

## Requirements
Ok, before you dive into the project make sure that you have installed on your machine following technologies:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) `^12.18.2`
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) `^1.22.4` or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) `^6.14.5`
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) `^3.9.5`

## Installation
After confirming that your environment meets the above [requirements](#requirements), you can clone the project based on `ts-react-redux-starter-kit` by doing the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DeanHristov/ts-react-redux-starter-kit.git <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
```

When you're done with the steps above, you need to install the project dependencies. I recommend you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn install # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```
## Running the Project

After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're able to run the project!

```bash
$ yarn run:dev  # Start the development server (or `npm run:dev`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`  or `npm run <script>`  | Description |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|`start`               |Serves your app in dev-server mode at `localhost:8080`|
|`run:dev`             |Serves your app in dev-server mode at `localhost:8080` with [webpack-dashboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dashboard) for a better monitoring|
|`build:prod`          |Builds production-ready code to **./dist** directory|
|`test`                |Runs unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)|
|`test:watch`          |Runs the tests in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|
|`test:coverage`       |Runs the tests in coverage mode|
|`test:coverage:watch` |Runs the tests in coverage mode and watch them|
|`ts-lint`             |[Lints](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) potential issues in the project|
|`ts-lint:fix`         |[Lints](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) potential issues in the project and try to fix them. Fixes linting errors for select rules (this may overwrite linted files) [TSLint command-line interface](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/cli/)|

## Project Structure

The project structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than the file type.
This structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [Fractal Project Structure](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure).

```

### Hot Reloading

The project support [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) provided by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
By default when the app is running via `yarn run:dev` or `yarn start`, the  reloading is enabled by default.
This feature is implemented with webpack's capabilities where code updates can be injected to the application while it's running. That means:

* For **JavaScript** modules, a code change will trigger the application to re-render from the top of the tree.
* For **Sass**, any change will update the styles in realtime, no additional configuration or reload needed.
* For **Global state** is preserved, but the component state is reset

## Routing
In the starter kit the routing is implement via  `react-router-dom` [React router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start). For more details please, see the [project structure](#project-structure) section for more information.

## Testing
To do implement via future task...

## Building for Production

## Deployment

Basically, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `./dist` folder generated by `yarn build:prod`. This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure!
